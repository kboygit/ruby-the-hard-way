def unique(array)

end





# Problem

# Build a new ruby script
# In the script, define a method called unique, which will accept an argument of an array.
# Have the method remove duplicate items from an array.
# For example, unique([1,2,3,2,1,6,9]) would return [1,2,3,6,9].
# Implement a version that uses the Array#uniq method.
# Implement a version that does not use the Array#uniq method.
# This version will loop through the input array and build an output array by pushing items on it,
#  depending on whether or not it is included? in the array.
