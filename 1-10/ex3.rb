#The use of #{3+2} in the code above is how you insert Ruby computations into text strings. You can put anything that is Ruby code between the { (left-bracket) and } (right-bracket) characters and Ruby will run it and put the result there instead of those characters. It may not make a lot of sense right now, but you will use this more and more in the book and begin to understand it as you work.

puts "I will now count my chickens:"

puts "Hens #{25 + 30/6}"
puts "Rooster #{100-25 * 3 % 4}"

puts "Now I will count the eggs:"

puts 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6

puts "Is it true that 3+2 < 5-7?"

puts 3 + 2  < 5 - 7

puts "What is 3+2? #{3+2}"
puts "What is 5 - 7? #{5-7}"

puts "Oh, that's why it's false."

puts "How about some more."

puts "Is it greater? #{5 > -2}"
puts "Is it greater or equal? #{5 <= -2}"
